Example of training a network for the MNIST dataset in C++.
Uses PyTorch and a library developed by me based in PyTorch that exploits posits (from universal).
The main class is StdTensor, which can implement tensors with posits.

(Describe network)

The library developed (based in PyTorch) to do deep learning with posits has the following files:
	Convert.hpp
	Init.hpp
	Linear.hpp
	Loss.hpp
	Matrix.hpp
	Net.hpp
	Optimizer.hpp
	Parameter.hpp
	SaveLoad.hpp
	Sigmoid.hpp
	StdTensor.hpp
	type_name.hpp
	utils.hpp
